## Building the Header

#### Topics covered

- The best way to perform a basic reset using the universal selector

- How to set project-wide font definitions

- How to clip parts of elements using clip-path

The **clip-path** property lets you clip an element to a basic shape or to an SVG source.

Note: The clip-path property will replace the deprecated clip property.



**The linear-gradient() function** sets a linear gradient as the background image.

To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops.
Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among.
You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

The **url()** CSS function is used to include a file. The parameter is an absolute URL, a relative URL, or a data URI.

The url() function can be passed as a parameter of another CSS functions, like the attr() function.
Depending on the property for which it is a value, the resource sought can be an image, font, or a stylesheet.
The url() functional notation is the value for the <url> data type.

#### The easiest way to center anything with the *transform*, *top*, and *left* properties.

The **transform** property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element.
This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.

You can use the **translate()** method with the transform property to move an element from its current position.
